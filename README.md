# Deep_learning

This is my personal `Deep_learning` folder structure. It's highly inspired by [cookiecutter-data-science](https://drivendata.github.io/cookiecutter-data-science). It's even more minimalistic so it doesn't require additional libraries or OS dependecies. So i suggest start with this minimalistic setup, but use the best practices of [cookiecutter-data-science](https://drivendata.github.io/cookiecutter-data-science)

## Requirements
cookiecutter Python package >= 1.4.0: `pip install cookiecutter virtualenv virtualenvwrapper`

## Starting a new project
Starting a new project is as easy as running this command at the command line. No need to create a directory first, the cookiecutter will do it for you.

```bash
cookiecutter https://github.com/willembressers/deep_learning
```
